# ðŸ“Š **Salary in San Francisco EDA Project** ðŸŒ‰

In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on salary data from San Francisco. This EDA aimed to uncover insights, trends, and interesting observations within the dataset.

**Project Highlights:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** I began by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types where necessary to ensure data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I explored various aspects of the dataset, including salary distributions, bimodal distributions, and job title analysis.

3. **Key Findings:**
   - Average BasePay, median, and standard deviation were calculated.
   - Bimodal distribution analysis revealed two distinct salary groups.
   - Top job titles and their frequencies were identified.
   - Answers to specific questions about the dataset were provided, such as identifying the highest-paid person and jobs with the word "Chief" in their titles.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** I investigated whether there was a correlation between the length of job titles and salary, concluding that no significant correlation exists.
