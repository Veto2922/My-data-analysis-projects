This repo contains several data analysis projects I've worked on

# Project 1:
EDA Project: 12 Months of Sales Data Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼

In this data analysis project, I took on the challenge of exploring 12 months' worth of sales data for an electronics store. The dataset included a vast array of purchase information, including product types, costs, purchase addresses, and more. 

### Key Highlights:

### 1. Data Preparation:
- Merged data from 12 separate CSV files into a single dataset for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values, ensuring data quality and completeness.
- Converted data types to facilitate analysis.

### 3. Sales Analysis:
- Determined the best month for sales, revealing the most profitable period.
- Identified the city with the highest number of sales, offering insights into regional performance.

### 4. Time Analysis:
- Analyzed the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize customer purchases.

### 5. Product Analysis:
- Discovered which products were most frequently sold together, providing cross-selling opportunities.
- Explored the product that sold the most and offered insights into why it achieved high sales volume.

# Project 2:
ðŸ“Š **Salary in San Francisco EDA Project** ðŸŒ‰

In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on salary data from San Francisco. This EDA aimed to uncover insights, trends, and interesting observations within the dataset.

**Project Highlights:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** I began by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types where necessary to ensure data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I explored various aspects of the dataset, including salary distributions, bimodal distributions, and job title analysis.

3. **Key Findings:**
   - Average BasePay, median, and standard deviation were calculated.
   - Bimodal distribution analysis revealed two distinct salary groups.
   - Top job titles and their frequencies were identified.
   - Answers to specific questions about the dataset were provided, such as identifying the highest-paid person and jobs with the word "Chief" in their titles.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** I investigated whether there was a correlation between the length of job titles and salary, concluding that no significant correlation exists.

This project showcases the power of data analysis in gaining valuable insights from real-world datasets. It demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis in understanding salary trends in San Francisco.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and its insights.

# Project 3:
In this project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset that provided valuable insights into the dynamics of startup growth, covering key aspects such as location, marketing spending, and revenue. and I made a Dashboard and Report To ensure that the project's insights were easily digestible
